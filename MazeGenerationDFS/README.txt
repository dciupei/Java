	This project is to generate a maze using depth first search. With depth first search a node starts at the root and explores as far as possible along each branch before it has to backtrack. For a maze it is easy to generate because it will go as far as it can until it hits a dead end then it will back track to where it made its last decision. In this program a maze will be generated randomly with a specific width and height of rows and columns which will then be printed from a text file. 

	To start it off a width and height needs to be specified to the graph and a starting point will be needed which will be passed through the depth first search method. From the DFS method we will have created a spanning tree. The spanning tree is then passed through the Mazearator method where those walls will be removed and an enter and exit to the maze is established. After it is done removing the walls the width, height, and the rows and columns will be printed out into a text file. Then that text file is then dragged and dropped into the professors maze render and the maze will be created to see visually.
