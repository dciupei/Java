The program will only work for the input symbols a, b, c, d, e, +, &, *, E and 0. It will step through the expression and start building the NFA depending on what charcter and symbol is being passed through. - I built the program on my own computer using eclipse. I made a .txt file that contained one postfix expression per line. I then dragged that text file into eclipse and copied it into the programs library. That is about it because then the program will scan the file and get the expressions until there are no more.- NFA.java - this class converts the postfix expression into a NFA - Transition.java - this class just makes the new transitions needed for the NFA.java class and prints out the transitions
