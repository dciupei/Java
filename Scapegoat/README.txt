Description:

	In this program I created a scapegoat tree, which is a self-balancing binary search tree. The scapegoat in the program is the highest possible ancestor in the tree. The file tree.txt is passed through which has a list of commands that either insert, delete, search, or print the tree. Done can also be put in the file and that will end the program. Dr. Cochrans PrintTree.java file was used to print off the tree.

How to run:

    To run the program just open up the file into eclipse on the WSU system. Make sure the tree.txt file is in the JRE System Library and press the run button. The code will print out a file called "ScapeGoatTree.svg". Search for that using the finder and click on it that will bring up the tree in a web browser.
