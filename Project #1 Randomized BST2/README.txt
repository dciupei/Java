A Binary Search Tree that will create a balanced tree of the random keys inserted.

In the project keys will be inserted into a Binary Search Tree and arranging them into a balanced tree. If a key needs to be removed the key will be removed while keeping the tree balanced. If you need to search a key finding the key will not take long because the tree is balanced and can find the key fast. The main object of the tree is to organize words or numbers into a well balanced tree that could be used in the future. 

Building the code you will need the 4 main methods Insert, search, remove, and serialize. Those methods would have some sub-classes that will help with each method. Every time insert and remove the size the tree must be kept balanced using rotation methods or every time a key is added or removed. Running the code a main class will be needed that will generate a random input of keys. To test the code keys will have to be inserted, removed, and searched for to see if the tree works.
