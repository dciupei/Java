Description:

This program is the block-encryption algorithm (based on Twofish by Bruce Schneier, John Kelsey, Doug Whiting, David Wagner, Chris Hall and SKIPJACK by the NSA combined).It uses a 64 bit block size and a 64 bit key.

Build / Run:

To run the program open the terminal and 'cd' into the folder where the WSUCRYPT.java is located. Make sure the plaintext.txt and key.txt file are in the same folder as the WSUCRYPT.java. Then type in 'javac WSUCRYPT.java' this will build the program. Then type 'java WSUCRYPT'. Then check in the same folder and 2 new text files will be in there one with the encrypted message and the the decrypted message.

Files:

WSU_Crypt.java      //The program containing the encryption and decryption of block encryption algorithm.
plaintext.txt       // Message that is going to be encrypted
key.txt             // A 64 bit HEX key used to encrypt and decrypt message
README
